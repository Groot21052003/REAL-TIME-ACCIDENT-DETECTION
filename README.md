# REAL-TIME-ACCIDENT-DETECTION
ROAD ACCIDENT DETECTION USING TRAFFIC CAMERAS
THIS PROJECT HELPS IN IDENTIFYING ROAD ACCIDENTS FROM TRAFFIC CCTV FOOTAGES.
FOR DEMO PURPOSE WE INCLUDED AN OPTION OF UPLOADING VIDEO BUT WE CAN CONNECT THE LIVE VIDEO FOOTAGE INSTEAD OF UPLOAD OPTION
IT TAKES VIDEO INPUT AND DIVIDE THE VIDEO INTO SINGLE FRAMES AND A PRETRAINED YOLO5s ALGORITHM IS USED TO DETECT VEHICLES IN THAT VIDEO FRAME
EACH VEHICLE IMAGE IS CROPPED AND SENT TO CNN FOR CLASSIFICATION
CNN IS TRAINED TO CLASSIFY A VEHICLE IMAGE INTO ACCIDENT OR NO ACCIDENT CLASS BASED ON THE DAMAGE HAPPENED
SO IF ANY VEHICLE IS MET WITH ACCIDENT THE OVERALL OUTPUT WILL BE DISPLAYED AS ACCIDENT HAPPENED IN THE GIVEN VIDEO AND IMMEDIATELY INFORMATION IS PASSED TO EMERGENCY SERVICES ALONG WITH REAL TIME SHARING

THE MAIN FUTURE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT IS WE CAN INCLUDE THIS SYSTEM IN THE CAR DASH CAMS FRONT AND REAR AND USING AI WE CAN PREDICT THE CHANCES OF OCCURING ACCIDENT AND GIVE PRIOR INFORMATION
FOR REAL USE WE NEED MORE DATASET TO IMPROVE ACCURACY IN NIGHT VISION CAMERAS AND UNPROPER CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.
